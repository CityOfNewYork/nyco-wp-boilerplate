# NYCO WP Docker Boilerplate
This [tutorial](https://codeable.io/wordpress-developers-intro-docker/) introduces
the reasoning for using Docker really well;

> So what is that Docker brings to the table? One thing: consistency. It guarantees
> the environment will be identical no matter where you run it; Locally, on 50 different
> computers, in a CI (continuous integration) environment or in production - it will
> work exactly the same, because it will use the same environment and code.

Utilizing Docker will help us more easily and consistently manage our products,
specifically, ACCESS NYC and Growing Up NYC.
