# Proposal
This [tutorial](https://codeable.io/wordpress-developers-intro-docker/) introduces
the reasoning for using Docker really well;

> So what is that Docker brings to the table? One thing: consistency. It guarantees
> the environment will be identical no matter where you run it; Locally, on 50 different
> computers, in a CI (continuous integration) environment or in production - it will
> work exactly the same, because it will use the same environment and code."

There are more specific details on that page but the basic proposal is this; utilizing
Docker will help us more professionally manage our products.

Here is a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tOjk_6aBxLurST5QDz-dV00yezt5i-cBbSAM6kf-W8U/edit)
where we can work on creating a consitent Docker boilerplate that will work with
our agency's products. Specifically AccesNYC and Growing Up NYC.

Eventually, we can replace this readme with docucumentation on how to set up our
products generally so we have an agreement on the kind of configuration that is best
suited for each product.
