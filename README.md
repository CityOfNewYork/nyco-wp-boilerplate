# NYCO WP Docker Boilerplate
This [tutorial](https://codeable.io/wordpress-developers-intro-docker/) introduces
the reasoning for using Docker really well;

> So what is that Docker brings to the table? One thing: consistency. It guarantees
> the environment will be identical no matter where you run it; Locally, on 50 different
> computers, in a CI (continuous integration) environment or in production - it will
> work exactly the same, because it will use the same environment and code.

At NYC Opportunity, we are utilizing Docker to help us more easily and consistently manage our products,
specifically, [ACCESS NYC](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/ACCESS-NYC) and Growing Up NYC.

While these configurations are optimized for the needs of our specific products, they can be used to setup any development WordPress environment.

## Getting Started
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
2. Explore the different [branches](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyco-wp-docker-boilerplate/branches) of this repository for different configurations and instructions.
