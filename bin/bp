#!/bin/sh

# Creates an alias command for running a Boilerplate project bin script from any directory. Examples:
#
# bp push {{ instance }}
#
# or
#
# bp ssh {{ instance }}
#
# or
#
# bp backup {{ instance }}
#
# Set up
# 1. Change "bp" below to your project's shorthand (so it doesn't conflict with other projects).
#    The alias name (bp), the alias function reference (_bp), and the function name (_bp)
# 2. Change "/path/to/project/" to your project's path
# 3. Run ". bin/bp" to add the alias and try it out
# 4. Add ". ~/path/to/project/bin/bp" to your bash profile to have it added on terminal startup

alias bp="_bp"

_bp() {
  (cd ~/path/to/project/ ; sh bin/$1 "${@:2}")
